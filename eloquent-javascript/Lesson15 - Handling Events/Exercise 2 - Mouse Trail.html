<!-- 
Mouse Trail

Instructions:

In JavaScript’s early days, which was the high time of gaudy home pages
 with lots of animated images, people came up with some truly inspiring
  ways to use the language.

One of these was the mouse trail—a series of elements that would follow
 the mouse pointer as you moved it across the page.

In this exercise, I want you to implement a mouse trail. Use absolutely
 positioned <div> elements with a fixed size and background color (refer 
  to the code in the “Mouse Clicks” section for an example). Create
   a bunch of such elements and, when the mouse moves, display them
    in the wake of the mouse pointer.

There are various possible approaches here. You can make your solution as
 simple or as complex as you want. A simple solution to start with is to
  keep a fixed number of trail elements and cycle through them, moving
   the next one to the mouse’s current position every time a "mousemove"
    event occurs.

 <style>
    .trail { /* className for the trail elements */
        position: absolute;
        height: 6px; width: 6px;
        border-radius: 3px;
        background: blue;
    }
    body {
        height: 300px;
    }
</style>
<html>
<body>



</body>
</html>
<script>
    // Your code here.
    let dots = [];
    let iterator = 0;

    for (i=0; i<40; i++) {
        let newDiv = document.createElement('div')
        newDiv.classList.add('trail')
        dots.push(newDiv)
        document.body.appendChild(newDiv);
    }
    

    function drawTrail(e) {
        let divTrail = dots[iterator % dots.length]
        divTrail.style.left = e.clientX;
        divTrail.style.top = e.clientY;
        iterator+=1
    }

window.addEventListener('mousemove', drawTrail)
</script>
